## ðŸ“• Data Analytics Programming

In this class, I completed three homework assignments and worked on a project:

* Homework 1, 2, and 3 are a review of Pandas and Python, including data manipulation, function writing, masking and filtering data

* Project reviewed **college football gameday attendance** and completed some exploratory analysis in the attached writeup.
