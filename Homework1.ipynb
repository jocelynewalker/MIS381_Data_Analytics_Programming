Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable. - C.S.

The little pockets of early Chrstians survived because they cared exclusively for the love of `the bretheren` and stopped their ears to the opinion of the Pagan society around them. But a circle of criminals, cranks, or perverts survives in just the same way; by becoming deaf to the opinion of the outer world, by discounting it as the chatter of outsiders who `don`t understand,` of the `conventional,` the `bourgeois,` the `Establishment,` of prigs, prudes, and humbugs. - C.S.
